# SMBVT-Triplifier

This repository contains the Java-based software used by the Story Map Building and Visualizing Tool (SMBVT) (https://github.com/AIMH-DHgroup/smbvt) to generate a knowledge graph from narratives. The knowledge graph is modeled based on the Narrative Ontology (https://dlnarratives.eu/ontology.html) developed by CNR-ISTI.
